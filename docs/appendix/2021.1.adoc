== 2021.1

=== 2021.1.1

This is a drop-in replacement for <<v2021.1.0>>. Introducing the interface for `Property` broke the `mutate` operation,
for which no test was in place. This and the bug has been fixed.

[[v2021.1.0]]
=== 2021.1.0

2021.1.0 comes with a ton of new features and a handful of breaking changes.
Fear not, the breaking changes are resolvable by recompiling your application.
We turned `Node`, `Relationship` and `Property` into interfaces and provide now `NodeBase` and `RelationshipBase` so that you can
use them to build a static meta-model of your application. A `PropertyBase` might follow.

Find out everything about the new possibility to define a static meta model in <<static-meta-model,the manual>>.
The manual also includes a major part about the two new modules we offer:
`{groupId}:neo4j-cypher-dsl-codegen-core` and `{groupId}:neo4j-cypher-dsl-codegen-sdn6`.
`neo4j-cypher-dsl-codegen-core` provides the infrastructure necessary to build code generators for creating a domain model
following our recommendation and `neo4j-cypher-dsl-codegen-sdn6` is a first implementation of that:
A Java annotation processor that can be added to any Spring Data Neo4j 6 project in version 6.0.6 or higher.
It will find your annotated domain classes and turn them into a model you can use to build queries.

Last but not least: We added support for some expressions of the more generic http://www.querydsl.com[QueryDSL].
This will require `com.querydsl:querydsl-core` on the class path but only if you decide to call `Cypher#adapt(foreignExpression)`.
This is a feature that is driven by Spring Data Neo4j 6.1 in which we build upon this to provide a `QuerydslPredicateExecutor`.
Find more in <<query-dsl-support, this section of the manual>>.

==== üöÄ Features

* GH-154 - Make Node and Relationship extendable.
* GH-155 - Provide infrastructure for generating a static meta model.
* GH-156 - Create an annotation processor for Spring Data Neo4j 6.
* GH-167 - Add support for some Query-DSL expressions.
* Introduce a statement context for allowing anonymous parameters
  (use `Cypher#anonParameter()` to define a parameter with a value but without a name. The name will be accessible on the statement
  after rendering).
* Make rendering of constants as parameters configurable.
