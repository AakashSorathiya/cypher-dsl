=== 2022.6.0

`Functions.internalId()` has been deprecated to accomodate for Neo4j 5 later this year.
We are unsure if we will do this to `id()`, too (The method with the same name will be deprecated in Neo4j 5 and eventually
be replaced by `elementId()`).

==== 🚀 Features

* Add fallback from `elementId` to `id` on older Neo4j versions. (#407)
* Add calls for `elementId()`. (#406)

==== 🔄️ Refactorings
