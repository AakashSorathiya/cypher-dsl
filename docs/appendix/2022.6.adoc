== 2022.6

=== 2022.6.0

`Functions.internalId()` has been deprecated to accomodate for Neo4j 5 later this year.
We are unsure if we will do this to `id()`, too (The method with the same name will be deprecated in Neo4j 5 and eventually
be replaced by `elementId()`).

==== 🚀 Features

* Add fallback from `elementId` to `id` on older Neo4j versions. (#407)
* Add calls for `elementId()`. (#406)

==== 🔄️ Refactorings

* Deprecate `internalId` in favor of `elementId` on nodes. (#408)

==== 🧹 Housekeeping

* Dependency upgrades:
** Bump testcontainers.version from 1.17.2 to 1.17.3 (#403)
** Bump checkstyle from 10.3 to 10.3.1 (#404)
** Bump jna from 5.12.0 to 5.12.1 (#405)
