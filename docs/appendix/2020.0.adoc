=== 2020.0.0

This is the first version of the rebooted Neo4j Cypher-DSL project. This version has been extracted from https://github.com/neo4j/sdn-rx[SDN-RX].

It's a completely revamped API and we use it in all places in SDN/RX for generating Cypher-Queries.

We use https://calver.org[CalVer] in the same way Spring does
since early 2020 (see https://spring.io/blog/2020/04/30/updates-to-spring-versions[Updates to Spring Versions]) from this release onwards.

You'll find the manual of the latest release version under http://neo4j-contrib.github.io/cypher-dsl/current/ and the current development version - or _main_ - under http://neo4j-contrib.github.io/cypher-dsl/main/.
