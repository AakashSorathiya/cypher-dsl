==== ðŸš€ New module: The Cypher-DSL-Parser

2021.3 builds straight upon <<2021.2.3>>, with few additions to the existing API, that didn't quite fit with a patch release,
but belong conceptually into this release, which brings a completely new module: The `neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser`.

What's behind that name? A Cypher-Parser build on the official Neo4j 4.3 parser frontend and creating a Cypher-DSL-AST or
single expressions usable in the context of the Cypher-DSL.

The module lives under the following coordinates `org.neo4j:neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser` and requires JDK 11+ (the same version like Neo4j does).
We created a couple of <<cypher-parser-examples,examples>>, but we are sure you will have tons of more ideas and therefore
a looking for your feedback.

Here's a sneak preview. It shows you can add a user supplied Cypher fragment to something you are building using the DSL.

[source,java]
----
var userProvidedCypher
    = "MATCH (this)-[:LINK]-(o:Other) RETURN o as result";
var userStatement = CypherParser.parse(userProvidedCypher);

var node = Cypher.node("Node").named("node");
var result = Cypher.name("result");
var cypher = Cypher
    .match(node)
    .call(
        userStatement,
        node.as("this")
    )
    .returning(result.project("foo", "bar"))
    .build()
    .getCypher();

For this release a big thank you goes out to the Cypher-operations team at Neo4j, listening to our requests and ideas!
