=== 2022.3.0

*No breaking changes*. The minor version has been incremented due to the following changes:

* Changes in the `ExposesSubqueryCall` (new methods to expose `callInTransactions`, but that interface is not meant for
  external implementations anyway)
* Added a new type `Dialect` and a new default method `enterWithResult` on the `Visitor` interface (have a look at the JavaDoc
  for the rationale behind it).
