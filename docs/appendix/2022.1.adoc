== 2022.1

=== 2022.1.0

*No breaking changes*. The minor version has been incremented to notify about new default methods in our interfaces. Those
shouldn't concern you as a user though, as they are not meant to be implemented by you.

==== Noteworthy

Our integration tests on GitHub now uses the official GraalVM action: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-graalvm.
Thanks, https://github.com/meistermeier[Gerrit], for integrating it.
