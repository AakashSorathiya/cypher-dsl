== 2022.4

=== 2022.4.0

* Added `withoutResults` to both in-statement and standalone call-builders so that one can use procedures without results
  inside a pipeline. This won't break anything, as the corresponding interface is not meant to implemented by downstream
  libraries
* Compound conditions are now correctly immutable (as stated by the contract and its JavaDoc).
  This might break things if you have them changed inflight.

Thanks to @Andy2003 for his input on this release.
