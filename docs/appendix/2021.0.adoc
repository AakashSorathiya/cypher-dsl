=== 2021.0.0

2021.0.0 comes with a lot of new features.
Thanks to https://github.com/Andy2003[Andy] for his contributions!

Andy is one of our first users outside https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j 6].
He started to use the Cypher-DSL in https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-java[Neo4j GraphQL Java].
Neo4j GraphQL Java is a library to translate GraphQL based schemas and queries to Cypher and execute those statements with the Neo4j database.
It can be used from a wide variety of frameworks.

We are happy and proud to be part of this and even more so about the input and contribution we got back from Andy.

Of course thanks for your input in form of tickets and discussions go out to @utnaf, @aaramg, @K-Lovelace and @maximelovino as well!

==== Noteworthy

Two things should be mentioned:

The https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/cypher-dsl/commit/2d0c98af853c72d4cd61099c9d8f3209b7e4c7c6[bugfix for GH-121] might
change behavior for some users:
The changes prevents the forced rendering of an alias for objects when the original object - the one that has been aliased
- is passed down to the DSL after an alias has been created.

The original intention for that behaviour was related to Map projection, in which the alias is actually rendered before the object.

So now the use of an aliased expression the first time triggers `a AS b` respectively `b: a` in a map projection.
All further calls will just render `b`. If the *original* object is used again, `a` will be rendered. If that is not desired
in your query and you rely on the alias, make sure you use the aliased expression returned from `.as("someAlias")`.

The other thing are the combined features GH-135 and GH-146.
The `Statement` class has become a fully fledged accessor to the Cypher String and the parameters used and if provided,
the values for those. The following shows a small example:

[source,java]
----
var person = Cypher.node("Person").named("p");
var statement = Cypher
    .match(person)
    .where(person.property("nickname").isEqualTo(Cypher.parameter("nickname")))
    .set(
        person.property("firstName").to(Cypher.parameter("firstName").withValue("Thomas")),
        person.property("name").to(Cypher.parameter("name", "Anderson"))
    )
    .returning(person)
    .build();

assertThat(statement.getCypher())
    .isEqualTo("MATCH (p:`Person`) WHERE p.nickname = $nickname SET p.firstName = $firstName, p.name = $name RETURN p");

Collection<String> parameterNames = statement.getParameterNames();
assertThat(parameterNames).containsExactlyInAnyOrder("nickname", "firstName", "name");

Map<String, Object> parameters = statement.getParameters();
assertThat(parameters).hasSize(2);
assertThat(parameters).containsEntry("firstName", "Thomas");
assertThat(parameters).containsEntry("name", "Anderson");
