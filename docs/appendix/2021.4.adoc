== 2021.4

=== 2021.4.0

2021.4.0 updates the optional dependency to https://github.com/querydsl/querydsl[Querydsl] to 5.0.0. While this is API
not a breaking change, it can be when the Cypher-DSL is run together with Querydsl on the Java Module path. Querydsl
maintainer finally introduced automatic module names for all their module on which we can no reliable depend. As that
module name is however different from the generated one, it will be a breaking change on the module path. Therefore
we bump our version, too.

==== ðŸ§¹ Housekeeping

* Upgrade Querydsl to 5.0.0
