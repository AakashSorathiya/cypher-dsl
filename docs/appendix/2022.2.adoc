Thanks to @ikwattro for his input and feedback in this release.

* Add callbacks for a "pattern element created event". (#303)

==== 📝 Documentation

* Add an example how to track changed properties to nodes.
* Add rewrite example.
* Add examples how to extract modified labels for the Cypher parser.
